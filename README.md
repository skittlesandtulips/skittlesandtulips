# 🌸 Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 🌸

## I'm Jenn D'Haenens — part creative, part analyst, 100% curious.  
 
A proud **Tech Mom**, **data explorer**, and creative soul with a love for **chalk art, crocheting, and softball**. 
I'm currently navigating the world of **data analytics** while bringing a little creativity to everything I do. Whether I’m working with data or sidewalk chalk, I’m all about turning patterns and spreadsheets into stories and dashboards into discoveries.
